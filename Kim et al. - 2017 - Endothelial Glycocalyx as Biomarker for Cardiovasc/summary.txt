Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 April 01. V olume of endothelial glycocalyx = Total circulation volume measured using dextran 40 (A) â€“ Circulation volume measured by labeled RBCs (B) *RBC, red blood cellKim et al. Endothelial glycocalyx maintains the integrity of the interface between blood flow and endothelial surface, and prevents extravasation of salt, water and proteins. Demissei et al. Pahwa R, Nallasamy P, Jialal I. Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 mediate hyperglycemia induced macrovascular aortic endothelial cell inflammation and perturbation of the endothelial glycocalyx. Loss of endothelial glycocalyx during acute hyperglycemia coincides with endothelial dysfunction and coagulation activation in vivo. Endothelial cell glycocalyx modulates immobilization of leukocytes at the endothelial surface.
