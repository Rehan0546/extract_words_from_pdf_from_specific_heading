Novel urinary biomarkers in detecting acute kidney injury, persistent renal impairment, and all-cause mortality following decongestive therapy in acute decompensated heart failure. Urinary levels of novel kidney biomarkers and risk of true worsening renal function and mortality in patients with acute heart failure. Improved performance of urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury in the critically ill by stratiÔ¨Åcation for injury duration and baseline renal function. Urinary TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 as early biomarkers of acute kidney injury and renal recovery following cardiac surgery. CRS type 1: rapid decline in cardiac function (e.g., cardiogenic shock or acute decompensation of chronic HF) resulting in acute kidney injury (AKI). Worsening renal function in patients with acute heart failure undergoing aggressive diuresis is not associated with tubular injury. CRS type 3: acute decline in kidney function (e.g., AKI or glomerulonephritis) causing acute cardiac dysfunction (e.g., HF, arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction).
