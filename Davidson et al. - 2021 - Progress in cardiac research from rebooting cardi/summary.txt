While intracardiac stem cell injection appears to slightly improve cardiac function following MI, no clear mechanism had been established until Vagnozzi et al. The benefits of exosome-induced paracrine signalling on cardiac regeneration were also evidenced in human iPSCs derived from cardiac fibroblasts (CF-iPSC). Administration of this new compound at reperfusionand 24 h thereafter to mice with a MI reduced neutrophil and macro-phage accumulation, tissue fibrosis and cardiac damage, and improved cardiac function. One resourcethat will be useful for investigating this is the atlas of exosomalmicroRNAs from human iPSC-derived cardiac cells, created by Chandy et al. Chen L, Li X, Chen M, Feng Y, Xiong C. The ACE2 expression in human heart indi- cates new potential mechanism of heart injury among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. 3Other novel therapeutic approaches to limit cardiac damage and lessen adverse cardiac remodelling have also been pro-posed.
