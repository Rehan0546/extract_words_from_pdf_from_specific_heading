160, Many of the  ,identified, sex differences are subtle and easily ignored
161, Although the features presently ,identified,"  to “have sex” range from differences in growth, morphology, protein expression, and intracellular  signaling, males and females alike achieve homeostasis, likely by different means"
162," This consideration of  multiple variables controlled by microvascular cerebral vessel function is especially  important as a reduced response to hypercapnia is associated with elevated risk of stroke and  increased cognitive decline, two ",identified, sexually dimorphic risk factors [ 78]
163," Among the factors implicated in this difference are estrogen  and its interactions with EC and WBC [ 83], estrogen receptor distribution [ 106], sex  differences in glucocorticoid action [ 17], and inflammatory status [ 9], to name but a few  ",identified, factors
164,  Diagram of sexually dimorphic constituents ,identified, in male and female humans  influencing the three primary functions of the microvasculature: 1
165,  Mammalian capillary diameter ,across the," capillary network ranges from 3 to 5 μm, and the  EC thickness in areas away from the nucleus ranges from 0"
166, Exchange is driven by gradients in pressure driving fluid and  gradients in concentration driving solute ,across the, wall [ 105]
167, The amount of fluid or solute moved ,across the," endothelial barrier is a function of the  architecture of the pathways through and between the endothelial cells, the surface area for  exchange, and the physicochemical properties of the barrier media (including the glycocalyx  at the blood/EC interface and the extracellular matrix at the luminal and abluminal surfaces,  respectively) and of the moving material (where size, shape, and charge can be influential)"
168," Venules The majority of vascular volume resides in the venous component of the microvasculature,  and fluid exchange occurs predominantly ",across the, capillaries
169,1 illustrates a selection of sexually dimorphic features  ,across the," microvasculature from the arterioles regulating blood flow into the exchange  vessels; the capillaries where gas, fluid, and solute move between tissue and the circulating  blood; and the venules where inflammatory processes occur"
170," Reexamination of Testosterone, Dihydrotestosterone, Estradiol and Estrone Levels ",across the,  Menstrual Cycle and in Postmenopausal Women Measured by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry
171, Cross sections of fixed capillaries and  venules ,often, show pericyte foot processes in close proximity to the endothelial junctions of  vessels that display a transient loss of barrier function in response to agents such as  histamine and display massive endothelial gaps at times when permeability has returned  back to normal levels [ 125]
172," In human studies of exercise, the subjects were ",often, young males in  a medical school or the military
173, While we ,often, focus on the pathophysiology of loss of barrier  function (e
