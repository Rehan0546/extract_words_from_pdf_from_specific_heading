Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 October 31. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. Are there sex differences in the capillary blood volume and diffusing capacity response to exercise? Impact of age and sex on plasma natriuretic peptide levels in healthy adults. Although the features presently identified to “have sex” range from differences in growth, morphology, protein expression, and intracellular signaling, males and females alike achieve homeostasis, likely by different means. Capillary pressure, pulse pressure amplitude, and pressure waveform in healthy volunteers. The number of platelets tends to be higher in females than males suggesting a higher tendency for formation of clots in females than males.
